Description: # PVNet: Pixel-wise Voting Network for 6DoF Pose Estimation - cm107 Fork
        
        ## Navigation
        * [clean-pvnet's original README.md](orig_readme.md)
        
        ## Requirements
        * CUDA 10.X
        * Python 3.7+
        * Pip
        * virtualenv
        * Recommended OS: Linux (tested)
        
        ## Installation
        Before installation, please install the following apt packages.
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libglfw3
        ```
        
        If you have not already done so, activate the virtual environment that you want to install this package to. If you haven't created a virtual environment yet, please do so now.
        
        ```bash
        virtualenv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        After your virtual environment is activated, you can install this package.
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/cm107/clean-pvnet.git
        cd clean-pvnet
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Training
        Training-related code has not been refactored yet, and thus is highly dependent on relative paths, softlinks, and settings that are hard-coded in the original config.
        For now, please refer to [clean-pvnet's original README.md](orig_readme.md).
        This document will be updated once the training portion of this repository is refactored.
        
        ## Inference
        As of right now, the inference code has been completely refactored and re-organized into the [clean_pvnet package](clean_pvnet).
        
        The important inference-related classes and methods are listed below:
        * PnpDrawSettings - Drawing settings for PVNet model inference
        * PnpPrediction - Contains Pnp prediction data for a single detection (i.e. a single bbox)
        * PnpPredictionList - A list of Pnp prediction data
        * PVNetFrameResult - A collection of all pnp data and metadata in a single frame
            * draw - Draws pvnet prediction on input image given settings defined in PnpDrawSettings
        * PVNetFrameResultList - All pnp predictions and metadata in all frames
            * save_to_path - Saves all prediction data to a dump file
            * load_from_path - Loads all prediction data from a dump file
        * PVNetInferer - Worker class that handles all pvnet inference
            * predict - Gets PVNetFrameResult from an input image
            * infer_coco_dataset - Runs inference systematically on a COCO dataset
        
        For details on what parameters can be used in the above classes and methods, refer to [clean_pvnet/infer/pvnet_inferer.py](clean_pvnet/infer/pvnet_inferer.py).
        For a simple example of how to use all of these classes together in an inference script, refer to [test/example_inference.py](test/example_inference.py)
